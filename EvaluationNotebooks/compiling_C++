If you can't run the compiled cpp script, "openPIV_cpp_performance.o" you will have
to compile the script yourself. 

In Ubuntu, this is done by typing "./openPIV_cpp_performance" in a terminal in the
current directory.

Compiling the cpp code requires that the FFTW library is installed in your system. 
If FFTW is installed, this command should work for compiling the cpp script:

g++ openPIV_cpp_script.cpp -lfftw3

If you have installed the FFTW library but you still get a linker problem, you might
need to find and provide the path to the library file. In my case, this would look 
like this: 

g++ openPIV_cpp_script.ccp -L /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -lfftw3
